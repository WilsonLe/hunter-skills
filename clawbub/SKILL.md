# Clawbub – Clawhub CLI Skill

This skill allows an agent to **safely and correctly use the Clawhub CLI** (`clawbub`, `skills`, `bunx clawhub`) to manage AgentSkills.

## Mental Model
The agent acts as a **release engineer for skills**:
- GitHub repo = source of truth
- Clawhub = distribution registry
- Local install = consumer

Never skip the publish step.

---

## Core Capabilities

### Install a skill from Clawhub
```bash
bunx clawhub@latest install <skill-name> --force
```
Use when syncing local state with the registry.

---

### Import (publish) a skill to Clawhub
```bash
npx skills import <skill-folder>
```
Run from the repo root. This is required before others can install updates.

---

### Install Clawhub tooling
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/clawhub -y
```
One-time setup. Avoid interactive mode.

---

## Safe Workflow (Recommended)

1. Modify skill in GitHub repo
2. Commit + push
3. Import into Clawhub (`skills import`)
4. Reinstall locally (`clawhub install --force`)
5. Restart gateway

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Do not run destructive commands without confirmation
- Do not import from untrusted repos
- Do not overwrite skills you don’t own

---

## Golden Rule
If the registry and the repo disagree, **the registry is wrong until you import again**.
